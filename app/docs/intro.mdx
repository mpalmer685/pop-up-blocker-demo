# Intro

This app demonstrates how to open a new window after an async request. To try
it:

1. Go to the [admin page](/admin), where you'll see a list of users. Note that
   the [main app](/app) is not available yet because you're not logged in.
1. Select a user from the list and click "Log in with GET". This will open a new
   window with a loading indicator while an auth token is fetched.
1. Once a token has been fetched, you'll be sent to the [main app](/app) and
   logged in as the selected user. _Note:_ some users will cause an "error"
   while generating the token as an example for error handling.
1. You can also use the "Log in with POST" button, which demonstrates how to
   trigger a POST request after the auth token has been fetched.
